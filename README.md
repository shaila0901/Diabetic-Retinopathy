# Diabetic-Retinopathy

The dataset was taken from : https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/indian-diabetic-retinopathy-image-dataset-idrid

For the dr-1 code, the Segmentation folder was used, and instead of the given quinary classification, I tried to implement a CNN model that could perform a binary classification on the dataset. 

For the dr-2 code, the dr-1 code was improved upon, as I replaced my own CNN model with a pre-made Resnet50 model to perform binary classification on the dataset.
